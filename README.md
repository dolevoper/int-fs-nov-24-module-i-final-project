# Module I Final Project

## The goal
Replicate the given design.

Please find the mockups in this repository and some design tokens to use in the project (colors and font).

Use the starting `index.html` as a base, as it contains the icons used in the design.

## Submissions
Please follow the following steps:
1. Fork this repository
2. Implement the project
3. Open a pull request from your forked repo, to the original repo
4. In the portal: submit the final project's task - include a link to the pull request and to a working GitHub pages site of your implementation

## Extra requirements
* Must use SASS
* Must use either BEM or CUBE CSS
* Must use proper semantic HTML where applicable
* Should implement hover/focus/active states for interactable elements
* Should be responsive and fluid
* Should include at least 1 meaningful animation
* Should have a functional calendar/agenda toggle (no need to actually change the view)

## Extra advice
* Start with logicstics (fork and open a PR)
* Commit and push often and in small chunks
* Use a top down approach
* When moving to a bottom up approach - give priority to the important parts
* Done is better than perfect - it's okay to start with "bad" working code and improve in a separate commit
